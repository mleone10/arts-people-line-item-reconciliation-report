# Arts People Reconciler

This program aims to be an easy-to-use tool for importing sales and payment information from [Arts People](https://www.arts-people.com/) into [QuickBooks Online](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) via the [QuickBooks API](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop).

## Local Setup

To build the project locally, run `make`. This will output a `aprecon` executable in the root directory.
